# Natural Language Processing
**This repository will be used for natural language processing studies and projects.**

- **NaturalLanguageProcessing.ipynb:** First steps with spacy and nltk  libraries. Extracting and classifying most important words of a text about Alan Turing from wikipedia and making a cloud word. After that I trained a model with dataset "base_treinamento.txt" to capture two to kinds of thrills: fear and hapiness. After training model I uploaded a dataset from twitter to capture those (fear and hapiness) thrills and classificate them.
